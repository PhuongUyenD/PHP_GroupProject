Zane gazed out at the 
barren landscape, 
longing for some form 
of life. A sudden 
glint in the distance 
caught his attention - 
what was it? 


As he arrived at the 
mysterious object, he 
realised that this was 
the Orb of Zanda - the 
magical sphere that 
had brought such ruin 
to the lands. Raising 
his fire-axe above his 
head, Zane took a deep 
breath and brought the 
blade down with all 
his might. The world 
erupted into light as 
the magic was 
released, restoring 
the land to its former 
glory.
